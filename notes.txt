@Autowired-->Autowiring happens by placing an instance of one bean into the desired field in an instance of another bean.
@Component-->@Component is an annotation that allows Spring to detect our custom beans automatically. In other words, without having to write any explicit code, Spring will: Scan our application for classes annotated with @Component. Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them.
@Repository-->@Repository annotation is used to indicate that the class provides the mechanism for storage, retrieval, search, update and delete operation on objects
